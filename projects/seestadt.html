                    This Seestadt project is a community-based initiative that aims to educate and engage children in
                    Seestadt about the importance of climate change and gardening through the installation of
                    interactive and collaborative plant displays in public spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to create a sense of community among the children of Seestadt by encouraging them to
                    learn and explore together through these interactive displays. By using real plants, we aim to
                    foster empathy and understanding towards the natural world, as well as provide a calming and
                    soothing environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team member of this project, my role was to design and develop the interactive displays, which
                    included creating the hardware and software system requirements that controlled the displays, as
                    well as the
                    user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was a great opportunity for me to use my skills in design decisions to create something
                    that had a positive impact on my community. I am proud to have been
                    a part of this initiative, and I am excited to see the impact it will have on the children of
                    Seestadt.

        <h3>Provocative Requisits</h3>
        <p>
            Our project was based on the following provocative requisits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a sense of community among the children of Seestadt through interactive and collaborative plant
                displays
            </li>
            <li>Fostering empathy and understanding towards the natural world through the use of real plants</li>
            <li>Providing a calming and soothing environment for children to learn and explore in</li>

        <h3>Design Game</h3>
        <p>
            We used a design game to explore different ideas and concepts for the interactive plant displays. The game
            involved a series of brainstorming and prototyping sessions, where we experimented with different design
            elements and user interactions.

        <h3>Target Group</h3>
        <p>
            Our target group was primarily children aged 6-12 in the Seestadt community. We conducted research and user
            testing with this age group to ensure that the interactive plant displays would be engaging and appropriate
            for them.

        <h3>Design of the Interface</h3>
        <p>
            The design of the interface for the interactive plant displays was carefully considered to ensure that it
            was user-friendly and intuitive for children. We used a combination of physical and digital elements to
            create an interactive and engaging experience.

        <p>
            We are currently in the process of implementing the interactive plant displays in various public spaces in
            Seestadt. We are also planning to conduct further research and user testing to gather feedback and make any
            necessary improvements.
